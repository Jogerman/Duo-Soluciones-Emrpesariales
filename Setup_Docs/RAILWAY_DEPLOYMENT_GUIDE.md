```

#### Database (Supabase) - If Using

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails with UTF-8 Errors

**Problem**: Some blog/podcast files have encoding issues

**Solution**: Railway might handle this automatically in Linux environment. If not:

```bash
# Locally, convert files to UTF-8
git add . --renormalize
git commit -m "fix: normalize line endings and encoding"
git push
```

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Loading

**Problem**: App doesn't read environment variables

**Solution**:

1. Verify all required variables are set in Railway
2. Redeploy after adding variables
3. Check Railway logs for specific errors

### Issue 3: Build Succeeds but App Crashes

**Problem**: Runtime error after deployment

**Solution**:

1. Check Railway logs
2. Common causes:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Database connection issue
